##  This module specifies Dallas sensors of Mitsurunner    ##

# NOTE: Suitable with ESPHome version 2024.6.6 or later

# To minimize Mitsurunner restarts, a separate hub is created for each Dallas sensor.
# The system is made for two Dallas sensors.
# Each Dallas sensor is read every 5000ms, interval between reading Dallas_A and Dallas_B is 2500ms.

# Temperature sensor (Dallas DS18B20) and its update/measurement interval

  - platform: gpio

# to avoid 1w-sequence overlapping synchronize DS18B20-readings (12bit conversion takes 750ms)
